## Overview

Figure 1 shows a diagram of the SysFlow format.

Entities represent the components on a system that we are interested in monitoring. We currently support four types of entities: Pods, Containers, Processes, and Files.  As shown in Figure 1, Containers contain references to both Pods, Processes and Files, and the four are linked through object identifiers (more on this later).

Entity behaviors are modeled as events or flows. Events represent important individual behaviors of an entity that are broken out on their own due to their importance, their rarity, or because maintaining operation order is important. An example of an event would be a process clone or exec, or the deletion or renaming of a file.  By contrast, a Flow represents an aggregation of multiple events that naturally fit together to describe a particular behavior. For example, we can model the network interactions of a process and a remote host as a bidirectional flow that is composed of several events, including connect, read, write, and close. SysFlow also model events generated by the Kubernetes controller.

SysFlow enables users to configure the granularity of system-level data desired based on resource limitations and data analytics requirements. In this way, behaviors can be broken out into individual events or combined into smaller aggregated volumetric flows. The current specification describes events and flows in three key behavioral areas: Files, Networks, and Processes.

### Entities

Entities are the components on a system that we are interested in monitoring. These include pods, containers, processes, and files.  We also support a special entity object called a Header, which stores information about the SysFlow version, and a unique ID representing the host or virtual machine monitored by the SysFlow exporter. The header is always the first record appearing in a SysFlow File. All other entities contain a timestamp, an object ID and a state. The timestamp is used to indicate the time at which the entity was exported to the SysFlow file.

#### Object ID

Object IDs allow events and flows to reference entities without having duplicate information stored in each record.  Object IDs are not required to be globally unique across space and time.  In fact, the only requirement for uniqueness is that no two objects managed by a SysFlow exporter can have the same ID simultaneously.  Entities are always written to the binary output file before any events, and flows associated with them are exported. Since entities are exported first, each event, and flow is matched with the entity (with the same id) that is closest to it in the file. Furthermore, every binary output file must be self-contained, meaning that all entities referenced by flows/events must be present in every SysFlow file generated.

#### State

The state is an enumeration that indicates why an entity was written to disk. The state can currently be one of three values:

| State     | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| CREATED |  Indicates that the entity was recently created on the host/VM. For example, a process clone. |
| MODIFIED | Indicates that some attributes of the entity were modified since the last time it was exported. |
| REUP | Indicates that the entity already existed, but is being exported again, so that output files can be self-contained. |

Each entity is defined below with recommendations on what to use for object identifiers, based on what is used in the current implementation of the SysFlow exporter.

#### Header

The Header entity is an object which appears at the beginning of each binary SysFlow file. It contains the current version of SysFlow as supported in the file, and the exporter ID.

| Attribute     | Type           | Description  | Since (schema version) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|  ----- |
| version | long |  The current SysFlow version. | 1 |
| exporter | string |  Globally unique id representing the host monitored by SysFlow. | 1 |
| ip | string |  IP address in dot notation representing the monitored host. | 2 |

#### Container

The Container entity represents a system or application container such as docker or LXC. It contains important information about the container including its id, name, and whether it is privileged.

| Attribute     | Type           | Description  | Since (schema version) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|  ----- |
| id | string |  Unique string representing the Container Object as provided by docker, LXC, etc. | 1 |
| **state**      | enum | state of the process (CREATED, MODIFIED, REUP). | not implemented |
| **timestamp (ts)**|  int64 | The timestamp when container object is exported (nanoseconds). | not implemented |
| name | string |  Container name as provided by docker, LXC, etc. | 1 |
| image | string |  Image name associated with container as provided by docker, LXC, etc. | 1 |
| imageID | string |  Image ID associated with container as provided by docker, LXC, etc. | 1 |
| type | enum |  Can be one of: CT_DOCKER, CT_LXC, CT_LIBVIRT_LXC, CT_MESOS, CT_RKT, CT_CUSTOM | 1 |
| privileged | boolean |  If true, the container is running with root privileges | 1 |

#### Pods

The Pod entity represents a logical aggregation of containers in Kubernetes. It contains metadata about k8s pod including its id, name, and host and internal IPs.

| Attribute     | Type           | Description  | Since (schema version) |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----|  ----- |
| id | string |  Unique string representing the Pod Object as provided by k8s or OpenShift | 4 |
| timestamp (ts) |  int64 | The timestamp when pod object is exported (nanoseconds) | 4 |
| name | string |  Pod name | 4 |
| nodeName | string |  None name | 4 |
| hostIP | int32 |  Host IP address (the exposed IP address of the Pod) | 4 |
| internalIP | int32 |  Internal Pod IP address | 4 |
| namespace | string |  Namespace in which the pod runs | 4 |
| restartCount | int64 |  Number of restarts that have occurred for the pod | 4 |
| labels | string[] |  Labels associated with the pod | 4 |
| selectors | Selector[] |  K8s selectors associated with the pod | 4 |
| services | Service[] |  K8s services associated with the pod | 4 |

#### Process

The process entity represents a running process on the system. It contains important information about the process including its host pid, creation time, oid id, as well as references to its parent id. When a process entity is exported to a SysFlow file, all its parent processes should be exported before the process, as well as the process's Container entity.   Processes are only exported to a SysFlow file if an event or flow associated with that process or any of its threads are exported.  Threads are not explicitly exported in the process object but are represented in events and flows through a thread id field. Finally, a Process entity only needs to be exported to a file once, unless it's been modified by an event or flow.

>---
> **NOTE**  In current implementation, the creation timestamp is the time at which the process is cloned.  If the process was cloned before capture was started, this value is 0.  The current implementation also has problems getting absolute paths for exes when relative paths are used to launch processes.

#### File

The File entity represents file-based resources on a system including files, directories, unix sockets, and pipes.

### Events

Events represent important individual behaviors of an entity that are broken out on their own due to their importance, their rarity, or because maintaining operation order is important.  In order to manage events and their differing attributes, we divide them into three different categories:  Process, File, and Network events.  These are described more in detail later on.

Each event and flow contains a process object id, a timestamp, a thread id, and a set of operation flags.  The process object id represents the Process Entity on which the event occurred, while the thread id indicates which process thread was associated with the event.

#### Operation Flags

The operation flags describe the actual behavior associated with the event (or flow).  The flags are represented in a single bitmap which enables multiple behaviors to be combined easily into a flow.   An event will have a single bit active, while a flow could have several. The current supported flags are as follows:

| OP_RENAME     | (1 << 20)| File renamed | rename(), renameat() | FileEvent| 1 |

#### Process Event

A Process Event is an event that creates or modifies a process in some way. Currently, we support four Process Events (referred to as operations), and their behavior in SysFlow is described below.

| Operation     | Behavior  |
| ------------- | -----------|
| OP_CLONE      | Exported when a new process or thread is cloned.  A new Process Entity should be exported prior to exporting the clone operation of a new process. |
| OP_EXEC       | Exported when a process calls an exec syscall.  This event will modify an existing process, and should be accompanied by a modified Process Entity. |
| OP_EXIT       | Exported on a process or thread exit. |
| OP_SETUID     | Exported when a process's UID is changed. This event will modify an existing process, and should be accompanied by a modified Process Entity. |

The list of attributes for the Process Event are as follows:

| args |  string[] | An array of arguments encoded as string for the syscall. |  Sparingly implemented. Only really used with setuid for now. |
| ret | int64 | Syscall return value. | 1 |

#### File Event

A File Event is an event that creates, deletes or modifies a File Entity.   Currently, we support six File Events (referred to as operations), and their behavior in SysFlow is described below.

| Operation     | Behavior  |
| ------------- | -----------|
| OP_MKDIR      | Exported when a new directory is created.  Should be accompanied by a new File Entity representing the directory |
| OP_RMDIR      | Exported when a directory is deleted.|
| OP_LINK       | Exported when a process creates a hard link to an existing file.  Should be accompanied by a new File Entity representing the new link. |
| OP_UNLINK     | Exported when a process deletes a file. |
| OP_SYMLINK    | Exported when a process creates a sym link to an existing file.  Should be accompanied by a new File Entity representing the new link.|
| OP_RENAME     | Exported when a process creates renames an existing file.  Should be accompanied by a new File Entity representing the renamed file.|

> **NOTE:**   We'd like to also support **chmod** and **chown** but these two operations are not fully supported in sysdig. We'd also like to support **umount** and **mount** but these operations are not implemented.  We anticipate supporting these in a future version.

| ret | int64 | Syscall return value. | 1 |
| **FOID:** |  string (128bit) | The id of the file on which the system call was called. File Identifier, is a SHA1 hash of the concatenation of the path + container ID. | 1 |

### Flows

A Flow represents an aggregation of multiple events that naturally fit together to describe a particular behavior.   They are designed to reduce data and collect statistics.   Examples of flows include an application reading or writing to a file, or sending and receiving data from another process or host.    Flows represent a number of events occurring over a period of time, and as such each flow has a set of operations (encoded in a bitmap), a start and an end time.   One can determine the operations in the flow by decoding the operation flags.

A flow can be started by any supported operation and are exported in one of two ways.   First, they are exported on an exit, or close event signifying the end of a connection, file interaction, or process.  Second, a long running flow is exported after a preconfigured time period. After a long running flow is exported, its counters and flags are reset. However, if there is no activity on the flow over a preconfigured period of time, that flow is no longer exported.

In this section, we describe three categories of Flows:  Process, File and Network Flows.

#### Process Flow
